**OBJECTIVES:**
1. Understand the fundamentals of Linear Algebra.
2. Translate into the basics of Machine Learning.
3. Develop interactive exercises.
4. Document using Jupyter Notebooks.
5. Plan weekly study times, ask question and network!

>**Exercise #1 - Price Discovery**

Instructor: *Say I go shopping on two occasions, and I buy apples and bananas, and the first time I buy two apples and three bananas and they cost eight Euros. And the second time I buy say, ten apples and one banana, and the cost is 13 Euros. And the As and the Bs here, are the price of a single apple and a single banana. In these "simultaneous equations", how would you discover the price of individual apples and bananas?*

+
.....
2a + 2b = 8USD
(English: Two apples plus two bananas equal eight U.S. dollars.)

10a + 1b = 13USD
(English: Ten apples plus one banana equals thirteen U.S. dollars.)
.....
+

*This is an example of a Linear Algebra problem. I have some "constant linear coefficients" here, these numbers 2, 10, 3, 1, that relate the "input variables" A and B, to the "output" 8 and 13; that is, if I think about a "vector" [a,b], that **describes the prices** of apples and bananas.*

*Then this gets **translated into a cost, to find out how many I might want to buy**. And I can write this down as a "matrix problem" where the 2, 3 is my first trip, and the 10, 1 is my second trip, and then these are then matrices, that's a matrix then, and these are vectors.*
